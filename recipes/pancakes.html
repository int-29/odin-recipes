    <p>A very light and fluffy pancake recipe that requires fresh buttermilk, but it's the best I've ever made!</p>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Flour</li>
        <li>Sugar</li>
        <li>Leaveners</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Buttermilk</li>
        <li>Milk</li>
        <li>Eggs</li>
        <li>Butter</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a large bowl. Beat buttermilk, milk, eggs, and melted butter together in a separate bowl. Keep the two mixtures separate until you are ready to cook.</li>
        <li>Heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium-high heat. You can flick water across the surface and if it beads up and sizzles, it's ready.</li>
        <li>Pour the wet mixture into the dry mixture; use a wooden spoon or fork to mix until it's just blended together. The batter will be a little lumpy which is what you want.</li>
        <li>Pour or scoop batter onto the preheated griddle, using approximately 1/2 cup for each pancake. Cook until bubbles appear on the surface, 1 to 2 minutes; flip with a spatula and cook until browned on the other side. Repeat with remaining batter.</li>
        <li>Serve hot and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
