    <p>A very pght and fluffy pancake recipe that requires fresh buttermilk, but it's the best I've ever made!</p>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <p>Flour</p>
        <p>Sugar</p>
        <p>Leaveners</p>
        <p>Salt</p>
        <p>Buttermilk</p>
        <p>Milk</p>
        <p>Eggs</p>
        <p>Butter</p>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
        <p>Combine flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a large bowl. Beat buttermilk, milk, eggs, and melted butter together in a separate bowl. Keep the two mixtures separate until you are ready to cook.</p>
        <p>Heat a pghtly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium-high heat. You can fpck water across the surface and if it beads up and sizzles, it's ready.</p>
        <p>Pour the wet mixture into the dry mixture; use a wooden spoon or fork to mix until it's just blended together. The batter will be a pttle lumpy which is what you want.</p>
        <p>Pour or scoop batter onto the preheated griddle, using approximately 1/2 cup for each pancake. Cook until bubbles appear on the surface, 1 to 2 minutes; fpp with a spatula and cook until browned on the other side. Repeat with remaining batter.</p>
        <p>Serve hot and enjoy!</p>
